## Description:
Create rehearsal sessions in the cloud and play remote with your band-mates. The Koord App allows you to mix the session audio, and watch your band play in the video tab.

Greetings music makers!
Koord enables musicians to create remote rehearsal sessions in the cloud and play together online in real-time.

We have exciting news to share! With KOORD you can now play in real-time, and watch your bandmates in another city or even another country! Video integration is finally a reality. Simply put, we can now say that Koord is like "Zoom for musicians"!

Audio latency has been a huge barrier for musicians when using mainstream video conferencing software to play online in real-time. If you’ve tried this, you know how difficult and frustrating it can be to get things to stay in sync. This is primarily because audio latency in these programs is unacceptably high for musical performance. To add to the problem, their audio compression algorithms degrade audio quality so much that it will probably not be good enough for musicians’ ears.
Not anymore!
We just entered a new era of music collaboration where technology is opening an array of creative possibilities for music creators. Today, we can get creative from where we want, when we want with whom we wish to. The boundaries of what is possible have shifted.

Furthermore, flexibility is KOORD’s new watchword. We want you to be able to rehearse online with your bandmates without having to carry a computer with you everywhere you go. That’s why we also made the Koord App available for your mobile devices (Android, iPhone and iPad).

All you need to get started is a device with a decent internet connection, a pair of headphones to hear the session mix, and a creative friend within a radius of 1000 Km (620 miles) to play with!

We believe one of music’s greatest qualities is that it is a shared experience – we play, listen, perform, and rehearse together – at its essence, it is a collective art form.

Real-time remote music collaboration,
Fewer boundaries, more music!
